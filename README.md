# candidate-application-platform

A simple web application for searching jobs.
- The application has job cards, each cards showing the job details
- The application has infinite scroll implemented via the **IntersectionObserver API**
- The application fetches data from a server and displays only those jobs which doesn't have **null** values.
- Has filter options at the top for efficient search

### Not implemented
-[] filter options are not responsive(as I could not use Redux for state management, faced some problems with value mutations)
